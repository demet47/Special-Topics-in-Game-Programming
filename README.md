# PROJECTS FOR THE _SPECIAL TOPICS IN GAME PROGRAMMING_ COURSE

For the course, we had in class practice lessons in which we worked on unity projects hands-on during the class hours. They targeted the topics handled in lectures more to-the-point. Especially the ICP (in class practice) on networking was inspirational.

The three projects in this repository are the ones that were take-home. They are again Unity projects. First one was more of a get-used-to project for Unity. 

Second project required more creative content. We basically wrote a simple maze game with traps.

Final project was more individual. We selected the topic we were going to work on. Our main requirements were to use statistical information extrated from Unity (profiler etc.) and work with an experimental scene built in Unity. There were of course other requirements included, which can be traced from the README located inside the _Final Project_ folder.
